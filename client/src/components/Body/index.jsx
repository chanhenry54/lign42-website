                                <p>In the early 2000s, a new phrase was brought to life on the internet: <span style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>uwu</span>. Although its exact origins are unknown, uwu has become immensely popular, especially in the anime and furry communities. Its usage is often paired with a high-pitched cute-sy register of speech, which we dub the “uwu wegistew” (uwu register), produced through modifying speech or written media to match the tone of “uwu” in a manner akin to baby talk. Some individuals use this register in a mocking or ironic tone to joke around, while others use it unironically to give off the impression of cuteness or shyness. In both cases, audiences express feelings ranging from cringiness to adoration, depending on the usage.</p>
                                <p>The uwu register, upon its introduction into the internet, found its way into many forms of media. Such forms include videos depicting the register in songs and general daily communication, and copypastas that integrate the register in writing. One such example of the uwu register in the wild is a <a href="https://i-am-a-fish.tumblr.com/post/168157413417/imagine-reading-a-post-but-over-the-course-of-it" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">copypasta by I am a fish on Tumblr</a>, which goes as follows:</p>
                                <p style={{fontStyle: 'italic'}}>Imagine reading a post, but over the course of it the quality seems to deteriorate and it gets wose an wose, where the swenetence stwucture and gwammer rewerts to a pwoint of uttew non swence, an u jus dont wanna wead it anymwore (o´ω｀o) awd twa wol owdewl iws jus awfwul (´･ω･`);. bwt tw powost iwswnwt obwer nyet, it gwos own an own an own an own. uwu wanyaa stwop weadwing bwut uwu cwant stop wewding, uwu stwartd thwis awnd ur gwoing two fwinibsh it nowo mwattew wat! uwu hab mwoxie kwiddowo, bwut uwu wibl gwib ub sowon. i cwan wite wike dis fwor owors, swo dwont cwalengbe mii..</p>

                                <p>This copypasta starts off in regular and grammatically correct English and slowly integrates the uwu register until the tone of the post has completely changed. It also contains many popular features of the uwu register, most notably the kaomoji emoticons and distorted text.</p>
                                <p>In order to better understand the uwu register and how it is viewed by the general public, we decided to conduct research on various properties of the register from a linguistic perspective. Through our findings, we hope to provide key insights into the world of the uwu register.</p>

                            <p>While there is very little existing literature on the popular usage of uwu, one thesis paper, authored by Bailey Bigott at the University of Georgia, provided us an extensive sociolinguistic perspective on the uwu register, which they name “Mock Infantile Speech” (MIS) [1]. This paper connects various phonological features and sociolinguistic associations of MIS to characterize a larger “uwu” persona. This persona indexes interest in subcultures such as gaming, anime, and “cute” aesthetics.</p>
                            <p>In particular, Bigott names pitch raising, sibilant retraction, liquid gliding and deletion, and interdental stopping to be characteristic phonological features of MIS.</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Pitch raising: “The mean frequency for speakers using MIS was 349.2935 hertz (Hz), while speakers in the standard guise had a pitch average of 236.645 Hz.”</li>
                                <li>Sibilant retraction: “Nearly all speakers demonstrated retraction of some kind, with retraction of /s/ to /ʃ/ being much more frequent than the voiced counterpart /z/, possibly due to the infrequency of /ʒ/ in English.”</li>
                                <li>Liquid modification: “Speakers using Mock Infantile Speech generally glided and elided liquids at markedly different rates than speakers in the standard guise.” “Liquids tended to be modified in the mock guise following palatal and velar consonants and following vowels.”</li>
                                <li>Interdental stopping: “Speakers often change the voiced and voiceless interdental fricatives /θ/ and /ð/ to the alveolar stops /t/ and /d/, respectively.”</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Bigott specifically names TikTok and Youtube as prominent platforms on which MIS is used. According to Bigott, MIS “adopts features of child speech, creating an image of sensual hyperfemininity for consumption” in these online spaces. Bigott concluded that imitating child speech was the primary component of successfully producing MIS.</p>

                                <h2>orthography</h2>
                                <p>An uwu-ification of a word is an alternative way to spell a word such as to convey that the writer is writing with the uwu register. In an initial survey of online text data, we find that there may be several different ways to uwu-ify a word. A consistent trend we see among both acceptability rankings and respondent comments is that the degree to which an uwu-ification deviates from the base word is inversely proportional to its acceptability. Several respondents expressed distaste towards over-uwu-ification and preference for following few simple rules.</p>
                                <p style={{marginBottom: 0}}>In our survey, we presented particular words and possible uwu-ifications to respondents and asked them to rate the acceptability of each uwu-ification of the word on a five point Likert scale, ranging from “not acceptable” to “fully acceptable”. The uwu-ifications of each word were generated by applying selections of orthographic rules to each word, which we derived from our initial survey of text data. The notable orthographic rules we employed are:</p>
                                <ul style={{marginBottom: 0}}>
                                    <li>“r” and “l” replacement with “w”
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Total replacement</li>
                                            <li>Initial replacement</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>“w” insertion</li>
                                    <li>Consonant deletion</li>
                                </ul>
                                <p>We employed two different versions of the “r” and “l” replacement rule: the total replacement rule replaces all instances of “r” and “l” in a word with “w”, and the initial replacement rule only replaces the first instance of “r” and “l” with “w”.</p>
                                <p>We sampled uwu-ifications and collected ratings for 12 different words. Quantitative analysis was performed by mapping choices on the Likert scale to integers along the range from 0 to 4, inclusive, with 0 being most unacceptable and 4 being most acceptable. The scores for each uwu-ification for each word is averaged over all respondents.</p>
                                <p>The uwu-ification that was identical to the base word (no orthographic change) was the highest rated uwu-ification for 8 out of 12 words, and the second highest for 3 words.</p>
                                <h3>“r” and “l” replacement with “w”</h3>
                                <p>We applied this rule to 8 words, and for 2 of those words we could distinguish between total replacement and initial replacement. The uwu-ification generated from this rule is the highest rated form for 3 of these words, second highest for 4 words, and third highest for 1 word. Initial replacement is second highest and third highest for the two words.</p>
                                <img src={images['rlreplacement.png']} alt="graph1"/>
                                <p>We notice that there is a consistent trend in acceptability ratings related to the position of the “r” or “l” consonant. When “r” or “l” is before a vowel, the acceptability of the uwu-ification generated from this rule is higher than that of the base word. Inversely, when “r” or “l” is after a vowel, the acceptability of the uwu-ification generated from this rule is lower than that of the base word. This suggests that the orthographic rule that informs how “r” and “l” consonants are replaced is dependent on the environment of the replaced consonant.</p>
                                <img src={images['itreplacement.png']} alt="graph2"/>
                                <p>For the first word, “structure”, there is little variation in the acceptability across the three conditions. For the second word, “rather”, there is a significant decrease in acceptability when we replace the latter “r”, which occurs after a vowel. This supports our hypothesis that replacing “r”s and “l”s after vowels are generally not acceptable.</p>
                                <h3>“w” insertion</h3>
                                <p>There are 5 words we applied this rule to for which we can isolate the effects of this rule alone. For each word we insert the “w” after the first non-”r” non-”l” consonant cluster in the word. In the case of “and”, we insert after the vowel to produce “awnd” instead.</p>
                                <img src={images['insertion.png']} alt="graph3"/>
                                <p>Consistently across all words, “w” insertion alone is correlated with a decrease in acceptability by a significant degree, with the exception of “post”/”pwost”.</p>
                                <h3>Consonant Deletion</h3>
                                <p>There are 5 words we applied this rule to for which we can isolate the effects of this rule alone. For each word, we delete the last consonant. In the case of “worse”, we instead delete the “r” to produce “wose” instead.</p>
                                <img src={images['consonantdeletion.png']} alt="graph4"/>
                                <p>Similarly to our results for “w” insertion, consonant deletion alone is correlated with a decrease in acceptability across all words.</p>

                                <h2>phonology</h2>
                                <p>Phonology is the study of how languages organize sounds and how sounds change in speech. The way that sounds change in language is described using phonological rules that delineate what features of a sound change and in what conditions the rule would apply. In this study, we are interested in what ways the uwu register differs phonologically from Standard American English. Through extensive phonological analysis of audio samples of the uwu register online, we have drafted a list of phonological rules that we find to be consistent across speakers and contexts. In the analysis, we plot audio samples onto spectrograms, which display time on the horizontal axis, frequency on the vertical axis, and intensity of a given frequency at a given time by its darkness. Spectrograms are often used in phonological studies to see what sounds are present in speech and how they are produced. In these spectrograms, we look for formants, which look like dark horizontal bands that can move up and down, to distinguish between sounds. All spectrograms are plotted with a frequency range of 1 Hz to 5000 Hz. All frequency measurements are performed using the <a href="https://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Praat phonological analysis software tool.</a></p>

                                        <p>In the phonological rule above, L represents liquids. </p>
                                        <p>This is the most common and characteristic rule associated with the uwu register. This phonological rule almost perfectly mirrors its orthographic counterpart where “r”s and “l”s are replaced with “w”s. </p>
                                        <p>While this rule is applied to liquids in any environment, we notice that speakers may inconsistently ignore this rule for parts of a word. We hypothesize that this occurs when users have trouble maintaining speech in the uwu register and inadvertently slip back into Standard American English. In the few cases where this occurs, they occur word-finally.</p>

                                    <p>We notice in both spectrograms for both examples that the ends do not show any movement of F2 or F3 that might be indicative of [w] replacement. It appears that the dark [ɫ] (or simply syllable-final liquids) is not transformed.</p>

C0 represents “any number of consonants, including none”, used to capture all possible coda clusters.
                                        Given that Standard American English does not allow [w] to be the coda of a syllable, we believe that this rule is phonotactically motivated by English coda constraints.

                                        <p>In the phonological rule above, $ represents the syllable boundary, used to indicate that the consonant cluster is the onset of its syllable. C0 represents “any number of consonants, including none”, used to capture all possible onset clusters. </p>
                                        <p>[w] may not be inserted in the middle of an onset cluster between consonants; only between the onset cluster and the nucleus.</p>
                                        <p>This general rule unintentionally excludes onsets that end in [h]. For the sake of brevity, we exclude [h] from the rule, since including [h] would exclude the [+consonantal] feature and form a natural class with [ɹ j w], which we aim to exclude. However, since [hw] is a valid onset in American English, we believe that onsets ending in [h] may be subject to this rule, although we were not able to collect any data to support this hypothesis.</p>
                                        <p>This rule does not always apply to the same environments across speakers and contexts, however every speaker exhibits the ability to apply this rule. Identical syllables and words may be produced with or without the application of this rule across and within speakers. We hypothesize that this variation may simply be a form of free variation. Another hypothesis suggests that the variation in the application of this rule is related to the orthographic form of the word. One common trend we noticed among survey results was that respondents were hesitant to leave sequences of words without any orthographic changes (due to the lack of “r”s and “l”s) and would insert “w”s accordingly. Since [w] is restricted from English codas, speakers would naturally insert “w” in the onset of syllables. This hypothesis would mean that the rule is more likely to apply to words in environments deficient in “r”s and “l”s.</p>

                            <p>Our findings revealed several gaps in our survey that could be filled in with further data collection. Firstly, we were able to explore the effects of certain orthographic rules on the generation of uwu-ifications. However, the data we have collected is quite scant, and does not provide enough evidence to make any strong conclusions about what the real conditions of the orthographic rules are. There were multiple points during the phonological analysis in which we realized that the conditions of a phonological rule could be accounted for by taking into consideration other linguistic features, such as syllable constraints. We could support or disprove these hypotheses by collecting more data with a focus on obtaining more information about the kinds of environments these phonological rules would apply. We would also like to collect information about how much people personally use the uwu register in their daily lives, as personal familiarity with the register may allow these respondents to provide more nuance about the linguistic features of the register</p>
                            <p>Survey responses also revealed other dimensions of the uwu register that we had not considered exploring. For example, some survey responses remarked that “uwu” may be realized as a part of speech and used in a sentence. In this study we had only considered “uwu” and its related forms as morphemes that do not have any syntactic constraints and act as mood or tone markers. This study has also presumed that the data we collected comes from speakers of Standard American English. Since we surveyed mostly students in an American university and collected data from English online sources, this assumption may very well be true, but we believe that it would merit the effort to investigate how the uwu register varies or would vary cross-linguistically.</p>
